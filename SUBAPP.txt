Add sub application to route

subapp = web.Application()
# setup subapp routes and middlewares

app.add_subapp('/prefix/', subapp)

Middlewares from app and subapp are chained.
Signals are not (probably?)

Application can be used eighter as main app (app.make_handler()) or as
subapp -- not both cases at the same time.

Url reversing for subapp should generate urls with subapp prefix.

SubAppResource is a regular prefixed resource with single route for
sinking every request into subapp.
